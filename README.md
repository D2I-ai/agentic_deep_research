## üåü Overview

This project provides a lightweight yet powerful agentic framework designed to enable **multi-hop web search** and **automated deep research report generation** using the function-calling capabilities of LLMs. It empowers developers and researchers to build autonomous agents that can search, reason, and synthesize information from the web with minimal setup.

Whether you're building a research assistant, competitive intelligence tool, or knowledge curation system, this project provides a clean, modular, and easy-to-extend foundation.

## üöÄ Quickstart

### 1. Use Dashscope API
Dashscope is a platform providing AI-powered APIs and tools for natural language processing, computer vision, and other machine learning tasks. You can get the LLM API from Dashscope.
1. [Dashscope Uasge](https://github.com/dashscope/dashscope-sdk-python)
2. [Get Your API Key](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/use-qwen-by-calling-api?spm=a2c4g.11186623.0.0.46197d9dC7SfoW) ÔΩú [Ëé∑ÂèñÊÇ®ÁöÑ API Key](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/use-qwen-by-calling-api?spm=a2c4g.11186623.0.0.46197d9dC7SfoW)
3. Put your API key in `_settings.py`


### 2. Websearch Tools
Websearch tools are used to perform websearch and retrieve webpages for deep research.

#### Get Your search API Key
We support the following websearch tools:
- [Serper](https://serper.dev/)
- [Jina](https://jina.ai/)
- [Tavily](https://tavily.com/)
- [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.ai/)

You can set search backend in `_settings.py`:
```python
WEBSEARCH_API = ("jina")  # or "tavily", "firecrawl", "local_jina", "custom"
```

üí° Tips: 
1. We recommend [Jina](https://jina.ai/) for its cost-efficiency and excellent content extraction. You can deploy [Jina Read](https://github.com/jina-ai/reader) locally for full control. 
2. If you want to choose serper_api, you need to set the WEBSEARCH_API to `custom`.


### 3. Installation and Configuration

#### 3.1 Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/D2I-ai/agentic_deep_research.git
   cd agentic_deep_research
   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)
   ```

#### 3.2 Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### 3.3 Set up your API keys
You need to edit the `_settings.py` file and provide your API key. You need to provide at least dashscope API key and one of the websearch API keys.
   ```python
    APIKeys = {
        "dashscope_api_key": "your dashscope api key",
        "serper_api": "your serper api key",
        "jina_api_key": "your jina api key",
        "tavily_api_key": "your tavily api key",
        "firecrawl_api_key": "your firecrawl api key"
    }
   ```

#### 3.4 Test Your LLM API
   ```python
    python agent/model.py
   ```

#### 3.5 Test the websearch tool
   ```python
   python websearch/query2text.py
   ```

### 4. Run the deep search pipeline

Launch the full agentic pipeline:
```python
python agent/deep_research_demo.py
```
